        <ol>
          <li>Point Guards</li>
              <img src="rsz_pointguards.jpg" alt="" class="pointguardsimg">
            <p class="pointguardsp"> You will often see this person dribbling the ball up the court, and starting the offense.
            The point guard is often small/medium sized, quick, and can dribble the basketball very well.</p>
          <li>Shooting Guards</li>
              <img src="rsz_shootingguards.jpg" alt="" class="shootingguardsimg">
            <p class="shootingguardsp">This person could be on the left or the right wing of the court. The shooting guard is the best
            shooter on the team and can also dribble the ball very well. </p>
          <li>Small Fowards</li>
              <img src="rsz_smallforwards.jpg" alt="" class="smallforwardsimg">
            <p class="smallforwardsp">This person can also be found on the left or the right wing of the court. The small foward can
            be classified as a hybrid between a point guard and a shooting guard.</p>
          <li>Power Fowards</li>
              <img src="rsz_powerforwards.jpg" alt="" class="powerforwardsimg">
            <p class="powerforwardsp">This person can be found on the left or right block. The power foward is often bigger/taller
              than the small foward, and can have the same responsibilities as the center.
            a small foward and center can. </p>
          <li>Centers</li>
              <img src="rsz_centers.jpg" alt="" class="centersimg">
            <p class="centersp">This person can also be found on the left or right block. You can identify the center as
               the biggest/tallest person on the court. His main job is to get the rebounds and set picks.
            </p>
        </ol>

        <blockquote>***It is important to note that these positions are not perminant.*** Meaning that depending on
        the possession you might be a center in the shooting guard postion. It is best to just play the game
        and not worry about what postion you are.</blockquote>
