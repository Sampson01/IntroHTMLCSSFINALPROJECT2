          <li>What is a jump ball?</li>
            <p>In pro level basketball a jump ball occurs when the referee throws the ball up
            between two opposing players. For any other level, the team that did not get possession on
          the last jump ball will get possession of the ball.</p>
          <li>What happens when an offenseive and defensive player holds the ball at the same time.</li>
            <p>It is considered a jump ball.</p>
          <li>What are team fouls?</li>
            <p>Each time a player receives a foul, a team foul is also given to the team. Once a team gets over the
            team fouls limit (usually five or seven) the opposing teams is awarded a one and one freethrow
          oppertunity. Meaning if the player makes the first shot then they get another, but if they miss the first
        shot the ball is live.</p>
        <li>What is a pick or screen?</li>
            <p>A screen is a blocking move done by an offensive player. A pick is done by standing beside or behind a defender,
               to free a teammate to shoot, receive a pass, or drive in to score. </p>
