          <p class="accordingp">According to The Modern Encyclopedia of Basketball
             In the year of 1891, the first game of basketball was played at what is now Springfield College.
             The game was invented by a Canadian, Dr. James Naismith, a versatile athlete, theologian, and physical education instructor,
              who envisioned "the time when Christian people would recognize the true value of athletics."
              He designed basketball to occupy a class of disagreeable male students at the Springfield YMCA,
              who were bored with the calisthenics and children's games in their gym class.
              The game attracted players and fans almost immediately.
               By 1936, basketball was included among the sports at the Olympic Games and is now played in 170 countries.</p>

          <p class="enrolledp">Naismith enrolled in the training school for the 1890-1891 academic year. He stayed on to teach boxing,
             wrestling, swimming, and canoeing. Midway through the term, the faculty encountered a problem with a class
             of men who were preparing to be YMCA administrators. They were required to take an hour of gym class every day;
              when the weather turned cold, they were "increasingly bored and irritated by the winter regimen of calisthenics,
               gymnastics, and children's games such as Prisoner's Base."
              "What this generation wanted," wrote Naismith, who at 30 was about the same age as the discontented students,
               "was pleasure and thrill rather than physical benefits." The head of the department assigned Naismith to
               "the class of incorrigibles."</p>
